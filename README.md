This is a school project to create an animal game, designed with pieces as follows on either side:

Chinchilla, Wombat, Emu, Cuttlefish, Emu, Wombat, Chinchilla

The goal of this game is to capture the opposing player's cuttlefish. The pieces spawn on either side of a 7x7
grid style board, with player Tangerine moving first. The direction, distance and locomotion for each piece is
as follows:

Chinchilla:

     Direction: Diagonal
     Distance: 1
     Locomotion: Sliding
     
Wombat

     Direction: Orhogonal
     Distance: 4
     Locomotion: Jumping
     
Emu:

     Direction: Orthogonal
     Distance: 3
     Locomotion: Sliding
     
Cuttlefish:

     Direction: Diagonal
     Distance: 2
     Locomotion: Jumping

Each player may make one move at a time. Pieces that do not have the 'jumping' locomotion may not move over another
piece. If a piece that does not have the 'jumping' locomotion runs into another piece, but their distance has not been
met, the move is illegal and can not be made.
